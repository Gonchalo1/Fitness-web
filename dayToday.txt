Keep going with Nav and good steps with the footer.

Gonzalo day5:
Now im working in the contact section, maybe tomorrow I will finish that section.
I have to solve the problem with the message to be sent regarding the width issue 
because the text just keeps running and doesn't wrap down. Then, I have to change 
colors, fonts, and a few other details, and finish making it responsive. Also, I 
need to address the issue with the subtitle on the home page that's conflicting
 with a style I'm not sure about.
